#You have been transferred to a new team working on a mobile game that allows you to dress up a
#model and rate other models in a "Project Runway" style competition.

#They want to start prototyping the rating system and are asking you to make it.
#This prototype needs to allow the user to input the number of players, let each player rate
#a single model from 1 to 5, and then give the average score of all the ratings.

Ratings = []
players = int(input("How many players do you have? : "))
for i in range(1, players + 1):
    rate =(int(input("Rate this in a 1-5 : ")))
    while rate < 1 or rate > 5:
        print("Not a valid rate")
        rate = (int(input("Rate this in a 1-5 : ")))
    else:
        Ratings.append(rate)


print(Ratings)
print("The average is", sum(Ratings)/players)
